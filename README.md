# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Regression
In this project, I aimed at predicting the prices of used cars and  the right period for selling certain cars, 
on the basis of various features of the car like, fueltype, model, model year/purchase year,  
mileage etc.
 In this porject, I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization and will be using 4 regression models 
 for prediction namely: Multilinear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Lasso and Ridge Regression and Catboost along with
 validating and analyzing the results obtained.
